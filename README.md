# React + Vite

This is a polling app to use to create groups and vote on whatever suites your fancy. I am currenty working on modifying groups and emailing results to people in said groupds. 

The idea is protected groups can vote on whatever for whenever or subject a vote to all

The author of a poll can end the enrollment period or the polling period after which only the results will remain.

There is further hope I can allow the author of a poll to create a time limit for the polls, or even create the same poll with the same time like an alarm clock.
